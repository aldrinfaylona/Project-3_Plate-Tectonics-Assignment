# Project-3_Plate-Tectonics-Assignment

 #   Introduction:
 Plates moves around the globe and creates massive earthquake. Movements are cause by convection where hot liquid from the core are trying to rise to the surface. The purpose of this project is to study earthquakes with different magnitude and be able to plot it exactly around Juan de fuca ridge which is just west of Washington. There are three ways plates move: First is Divergence boundary in which two plates slide apart each other and magma rises, next, convergence boundary where one plate is moving underneath the other, Last is Transfor boundary where two plates slide along one another which can cause strong earthquake. These different type of movements cause eartquake which is measured by seismograph. The data recorded will then be plot on map to see their locations and magnitudes.



a.Across what geographic area are you able to observe earthquake data in this map? Why do you see most of the earthquakes in that area?
b.What is the range of earthquake size (magnitude) in these data? What is the average earthquake size in this area?

After different magnitudes of earthquakes are plot in the Juan de Fuca, it was found that most of the earthquake exist on divergence and transform boundary. However, Transform boundary shows more earthquake and greater magnitude.

c.Map the earthquakes in April 2015 (inlude this map in your report). Where are those earthquakes mostly located? What event can you link these earthquakes to?

Identify a divergent boundary and a transform boundary on the map you selected in part I.
d. What kind of patterns in earthquake magnitude and location you observe over time along each boundary?

From the transform boundary graph which has a red color line, we can see that most earthquake comes from this location with a greater magnitude. Normally, Transform boundary produces more magnitude since its plates are moving against each other kind of in a shearing movement. The scatter plot shows that most of the earthquake are below five magnitude.

Divergence exist just next to the transform graph as it shows with the green line, from the bottom divergence we can see that experince more earthquake than on the top divergence line. The bottom divergence most likely experince more earthquake since it's pretty close to the top and bottom transform boundary. Divergence is when magma pushes the two plates apart. It make sense that this type of boundary experience less magnitude since what's coming out is fluid. Unlike tranform boundary where two lands shear against each other.  Similarly to scatter plot above, it shows that most of the earthquake are below five magnitude.
