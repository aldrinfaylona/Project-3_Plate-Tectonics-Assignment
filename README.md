# Project-3_Plate-Tectonics-Assignment

 #   Introduction:
 Plates moves around the globe and creates massive earthquake. Movements are cause by convection where hot liquid from the core are trying to rise to the surface. The purpose of this project is to study earthquakes with different magnitude and be able to plot it exactly around Juan de fuca ridge which is just west of Washington. There are three ways plates move: First is Divergence boundary in which two plates slide apart each other and magma rises, next, convergence boundary where one plate is moving underneath the other, Last is Transfor boundary where two plates slide along one another which can cause strong earthquake. These different type of movements cause eartquake which is measured by seismograph. The data recorded will then be plot on map to see their locations and magnitudes.



 #   Questions:

a.Across what geographic area are you able to observe earthquake data in this map? Why do you see most of the earthquakes in that area?
b.What is the range of earthquake size (magnitude) in these data? What is the average earthquake size in this area?

After different magnitudes of earthquakes are plot in the Juan de Fuca, it was found that most of the earthquake exist on divergence and transform boundary. However, Transform boundary shows more earthquake and greater magnitude (shown with a red line). It make sense that most of the earthquake exist on the transform boundary since this is where two plates starts shearing from each other. This causes strong earthquakes which is what are detected by the data. 

The range of the earthquake as shown on the image below is from 2.5-7.8 in magnitude. The average is also calculated to be pretty low which is 3.4. This makes sense that the average is low since most of the earthquakes happening are pretty weak and big one which is above 5 in magnitude rarely happens.

c.Map the earthquakes in April 2015 (inlude this map in your report). Where are those earthquakes mostly located? What event can you link these earthquakes to?

Axial seamount is an active volcano just recently been detected in the 1970s. According from records, large packs of sensors were dropped in the 1980s. Since it is located on the divergence zone, lava flows have been detected from time to time in which it pushes the two plates apart. It erupted back in 2011 which produced a mile wide lava flow. However, it recenlty just erupted again in 2015 in which what our sensors probably recorded. The scatter plot seems to be odd, but suddenly shows numerous earthquake in mid arpil of 2015.

Identify a divergent boundary and a transform boundary on the map you selected in part I.
d. What kind of patterns in earthquake magnitude and location you observe over time along each boundary?

From the transform boundary graph which has a red color line, we can see that most earthquake comes from this location with a greater magnitude. Normally, Transform boundary produces more magnitude since its plates are moving against each other kind of in a shearing movement. The scatter plot shows that most of the earthquake are below five magnitude.

Divergence exist just next to the transform graph as it shows with the green line, from the bottom divergence we can see that experince more earthquake than on the top divergence line. The bottom divergence most likely experince more earthquake since it's pretty close to the top and bottom transform boundary. Divergence is when magma pushes the two plates apart. It make sense that this type of boundary experience less magnitude since what's coming out is fluid. Unlike tranform boundary where two lands shear against each other.  Similarly to scatter plot above, it shows that most of the earthquake are below five magnitude.

 # Conclusion:
Doing this project has thought me how to be able to keep researching things to get the code needed to solve this project. Overall, it was found that more earthquake exist on the transform boundary comapre to the divergence. I also learned how to plot different magnitude of earthquakes on a map.
